# السلام علیکم! I'm Mohammad Mehdi 👋

## 🚀 Full-Stack Developer | Problem Solver | Tech Enthusiast

I'm a passionate Computer Science graduate from SZABIST, Islamabad (CGPA: 3.84/4.00) who transforms ideas into elegant code. I craft robust web applications, build intelligent systems, and explore emerging technologies. My code is clean, my solutions are efficient, and my curiosity is endless.

My philosophy: Every challenge is an opportunity to learn, every bug is a lesson in disguise, and every deployment is a step towards perfection. I believe in writing code that not only works but tells a story of thoughtful design and careful execution.
